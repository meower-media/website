			<span class="legal-p">For accounts that remain inactive for a period of 2 years, we have a retention policy in place. To ensure account owners are informed, we will send a notification during the last 14 days of the 2-year inactivity period. After 14 days have passed since the notification, we will schedule the account for deletion 7 days afterward.</span>

			<span class="span-h3" id="Notification1"><a class="jump" href="#Notification1">#</a>Notification</span>

			<span class="legal-p">A notification will be sent to the email address associated with the inactive account during the last 14 days of the 2-year inactivity period. This notification provides account owners with information about the upcoming deletion and the opportunity to prevent it by logging into the account.</span>

			<span class="legal-p">After the entire 2-year inactivity period has expired (with respect to the 14 days after the initial notification), one final notification will be sent to the account owner stating that the account will be permanently deleted 7 days later. This provides a final opportunity for the account owner to prevent deletion by logging in.</span>

			<span class="legal-p">If the user logs back in after the 2-year inactivity period (with respect to the 14 days after the initial notification), the account will permit access but will be permanently deleted after an additional 7 days.</span>

			<span class="legal-p">The data associated with inactive accounts slated for deletion adheres to all aforementioned items in our data collection and retention policy.</span>

			<span class="legal-p">Our retention policy, coupled with notifications, ensures that we are only storing data that is actively contributing to the Meower community. If you have concerns or wish to prevent your account from being marked for deletion, simply log in to your account within the 2-year inactive period.</span>
